#  Pig Dice
This web app was created to allow two players to play a game of dice where one rolls twice then hits 'hold' to change turns, and the first participant to get to 100 wins! If a value of 1 is rolled by the die generator, then the respective player's turn is immediately over and their round total is 0.
